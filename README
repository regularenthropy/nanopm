# ❓ About :

nanopm is a command line password manager written in Go.  
It works on all Linux distributions that have GoLang in repositories.  
Unfortunately, it doesn't currently support Windows, but I'm working on it.
Stay tuned :)

# 💡 Features:

1. Database encryption via AES-256
2. Categories for entries
3. Ability to have an unlimited number of entries between unlimited categories
4. Ability to move entries between categories
5. Ability to generate strong password for the entries

# 🛠️ Installation:
```
Linux:  
    sudo make install

# 📖 Manual:

1. Initialising nanopm:
   - By default nanopm creates a folder .nanopm in $HOME, in which all databases (except ones passed as an argument) will be stored.
   - If databases aren't found, nanopm will ask you to pass "-n" argument to init new database

2. There are 2 different ways of selecting database in nanopm:
   - Run nanopm with "-f" flag, and pass database to it.
   - Select database from menu, which will be shown if nanopm detects any databases in $HOME/.nanopm
